> CRUD with Vue and Firebase

## You'd add firebase config by yourself under the src firectory
I simply removed my firebase.js when I committing this repo.
please add firebase config js file if you try to use this source.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
